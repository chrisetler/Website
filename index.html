  <div class="sectionContent" id="aboutSection">
    Hello, my name is Christopher Etler, and I am currently a 3rd year student studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics
    at Rutgers University - Newark. I graduated from Ocean County College in Spring 2015 and am excited to continue my academic career.
    My interests in computer science vary; I love programming and am looking to make a career out of it, but have not yet been able to
    decide what language/ area I would like to focus on, so my personal projects tend to be small and in many different languages, but
    overall with a focus on the more mathy side of things.

      Here are some of my more <i>presentable</i> projects. For a more comprehensive list,
      feel free to <a href="https://github.com/chrisetler">check out my github page</a>.

    <div id="projectList">
      <div class="listItem" id="todoHeader"><a href="#">Todo List</a></div>
      <div class="listDesc" id="todoDesc" style="display:none">
        A Java based todo list application that allows the user to specify a description, date and priority for items.
        Items are autosaved to a file that is loaded on startup, and can be imported and exported.
        Future updates will allow for importing and exporting in a more standardized manner, using something more widely
        supported, such as .CSV.

      <div class="listItem" id="mandelHeader"><a href="#">Mandelbrot Viewer</a></div>
      <div class="listDesc" id="mandelDesc" style="display:none">
        A mandelbrot viewer written in C++ using freeglut and openGL headers. The fractal is only re-rendered refreshed by pressing F5 or Space, making it easy to pan and zoom
        without having to wait for it to reload. Controls: Refresh - F5 or Space, Color Modes - 1-6, Pan - up,down,left,right , Zoom - (+/-)

      <div class="listItem" id="stegHeader"><a href="#">Image Steganography Applet</a></div>
      <div class="listDesc" id="stegDesc" style="display:none">
        A web applet written in ASP.NET and C# that allows one to hide an image inside another image using a concept known as steganography. I wrote this project as a way
        to familiarize myself with the basics of ASP.NET and html.

      <div class="listItem" id="hufftextHeader"><a href="#">Huffman Coding Text Compression Applet</a></div>
      <div class="listDesc" id="hufftextDesc" style="display:none"><span id="listDesc">
        A web applet written in ASP.NET and C# that takes in a snippet of text and returns a corresponding dictionary generated using a
        Huffman Coding algorithm, which when used to encode the text would reduce the file size almost down to the entropy of the text.
        Huffman Coding is a very general purpose compression method that is typically used after all other forms of compression (which reduce the entropy)
        to store the file in its low entropy format.

      </span></div>

      <div class="listItem" id="huffmancHeader"><a href="#">Huffman Coding Text (in c)</a></div>
      <div class="listDesc" id="huffmancDesc" style="display:none">
        This is a C program that performs the same function as the ASP.NET Huffman Coding applet, but runs much faster.
